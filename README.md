# **Covid19 Data Analysis**
- In this Project, I have analyzed the Increasing rate of Covid19 patients and I have also tried to find the relationships between various Human Development Index factors like Healthy life, Social support, Freedom, Per capital income and so on with Increasing rate of Covid19 patients. I hope you will gain insights about various Data Preprocessing techniques and specially about the factors that affect the increasing rate of Covid patients.

**Snapshot of the DataFrame**
- Here, I have processed the Covid19 Dataset and Human Development Index Dataset and joined them together to find the correlation between various features and columns. The snapshot of the DataFrame prepared after joining the two Dataset or DataFrames is shown below:

**Correlation Matrix**
- Here, I have calculated the Correlation between the Infection rate with Per capital Income, Healthy Life, Social support and Freedom. The obtained chart is shown below:

### **Visualization**
- My analysis remains quite incomplete without Visualizations so I have prepared the scatterplot to show the correlations between Increasing rate of Covid19 patients vs Per capital Income, Healthy Life, Social support and Freedom.
